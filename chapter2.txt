Autumn in India occurs from September to October and brings stunning warm shades of yellow and orange to nature. Colourful falling leaves, cool weather and the vibrant festivals accentuate the subcontinent’s beauty and truly is a season of joy. In contrast to popular belief that autumn in India is short-lived, the season extends for two months in most parts of the country and marks the transition from monsoon to winter.
